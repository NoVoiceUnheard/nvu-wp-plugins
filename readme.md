## Making Changes & Committing to GitHub

### 1. Pull the Latest Changes
Always pull the latest changes before making edits to ensure you're working with the most up-to-date code.
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
Modify files as needed. This may include theme files, plugins, or content updates.

### 3. Commit Your Changes
After making changes, stage them for commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

### 4. Push Your Changes to GitHub

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors while pulling or pushing changes, try:
- Ensuring you're on the `main` branch: `git checkout main`
- Pulling changes again before pushing: `git pull origin main`
- Checking for merge conflicts and resolving them before committing
- Make sure environment variables are enabled in php
